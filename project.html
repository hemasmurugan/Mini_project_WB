        <img src="Taj_Mahal.jpg">
        
          
          <p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District
            in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.
            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty
            has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour
            combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and 
            inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart.</p>

        <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive 
          enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh,with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The 
          private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered
          to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which was brought to a new level of refinement. Each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions.</p>

      <p>Charminar is a historic monument located at the heart of Hyderabad, Telangana.The monument was built in 1591 by Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah, the fifth king of the 
        Quṭb Shāhī dynasty,as the first building in Hyderabad, his new capital. Over the years, it has become a signature monument to and an iconic symbol of the city’s
        heritage. According to one legend, the Hyderabad region was reeling from a devastating plague at the time that Muḥammad Qulī Quṭb Shah was shifting his capital from
        nearby Golconda to the new city. He commemorated the end of the plague by building a mosque, which became known as Charminar because of its four towering and distinctive
        minarets, one on each of the building’s four corners. It formed the centrepiece around which Hyderabad was planned.</p>

    <h3> Hampi </h3>
    <br><br>
    <img src="hampi.jpg">
    
      
      <p> It is a site of over 1600 monuments on a 41.5 sq km spread, the Group of Monuments at Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in
        east-central Karnataka close to the state border with Andhra Pradesh. Though it is the Vijayanagara Empire which left an indelible mark on Hampi’s heritage by emerging
        as the richest and most prosperous Hindu empires, the site itself predates this grand southern empire. The Ashokan epigraphy, and its references in the Ramayana and Puranas
        as Pampaa Devi Tirtha Kshetra only corroborates the fact the Hampi is an ancient site.Eventually in the 10th century it expanded into a centre for religion and education under the Chalukyas. 
        The  king, Kalyana Chalukya, granted land for the construction of the spectacular Virupaksha temple.
        Hampi flourished between 12th and 14th centuries under the Hoysala Empire who built majority of the temples you will find on the site, such as the Durga, Shiva and Hampadevi temples. </p>

    <h3> Fatehpur Sikri </h3>
    <br><br>
    <img src="Fatehpur Sikri.jpg">
    
      
      <p>Fatehpur Sikri is a a city predominantly in red sand-stone, situated at a distance of 37 kms from Agra, was built by the Mughal Emperor Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar,
        in honour of the great Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chisti ; its magnificence and uniqueness offers a fine example of the emperor's architectural finesse. Akbar's tolerant religious 
        views and interest in literature, architecture and fine arts gave the buildings at Fatehpur Sikri a charismatic blend of Islamic and Hindu elements in their style and design.
        At Fatehpur Sikri during sunset and sunrise, the turrets and domes create shadows and silhouette against the copper red sky; which truly is an inspirational scene for a painter's 
        canvas or the visitor's eyes. It is enclosed by a 11 kms long fortification wall interspersed with numerous gateways. The remains of the great city, the Imperial Palace Complex, 
        the intricately built marble tomb of the great Sufi saint, Sheikh Salim Chisti and the grand mosque are a benchmark of architectural beauty.</p>
